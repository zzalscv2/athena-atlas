/** 
Class to filter events based on the decay of a parent particle into a set of children particles.
User specifies the parent particle pdg ID and a list of children particle pdg IDs to filter on.
It was designed with the single particle gun generator in mind, but should in principle
work in any sample.
It has been tested, when generating 10k events, to give filter efficiencies consistent with 
the expected branching ratios from the PDG in the cases of w(782)->pi+pi-pi0, w(782)->pi0 + gamma
