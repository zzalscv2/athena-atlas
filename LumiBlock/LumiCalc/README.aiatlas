This file gives instructions for setting up the lumicalc web service.  
Instructions have been updated on July 29, 2020 for the new centos7 server
For more details: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CSOPS-1700

There is one server now with prod and dev areas:
aiatlas031.cern.ch 
-> https://atlas-lumicalc.cern.ch in /var/www/lumicalc
-> https://atlas-lumicalc-dev.cern.ch in /var/www/lumicalc_dev

So log into aiatlas031

Change to a directory where you have write permission:
cd /var/www/lumicalc_dev

# Setup git environment
export ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE=/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase
source ${ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE}/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh
lsetup git

# Sparse checkout (actually checks out my fork)
git atlas init-workdir https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/atlas/athena.git -p LumiCalc

# See what you really did with
cd athena
git remote -v
cd ..

# For the dev area, lets use a dev branch
git checkout -b lumicalcDev
git push --set-upstream origin lumicalcDev

# So for me, origin is my fork, while upstream is the atlas main

# Setup build environment
mkdir build; cd build
asetup main,latest,Athena  # Or a fixed release
cmake ../athena/Projects/WorkDir
make -j

# And everything should now be ready to go
# Be sure to test atlas-lumicalc-dev before updating the prod area from main

# For updates, log into aiatlas031 and go to the correct area:
cd /var/www/lumicalc_dev

# Ensure we are on the correct branch (if needed)
# <branch> = main (prod)
# <branch> = lumicalcDev (dev)
git checkout <branch>

# Pull any changes
git fetch origin
git pull origin <branch>

# Rebuild if any code changes

# Once tested, push changes back to main (or make merge request)

Go to the correct area:
cd /
# This can be used to check the environment
https://atlas-lumicalc-dev.cern.ch/cgi-bin/TestEnviron.py

# Config files can be found at
sudo emacs /etc/httpd/conf.d/25-atlas-lumicalc-dev.cern.ch_vhost.conf

# Restart apache if changes are made
sudo systemctl restart httpd

# To turn off puppet (for both userid and root):
puppet agent --disable "Eric: testing config files"
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent --disable "Eric: testing config files"
