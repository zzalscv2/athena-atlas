 *
 * This class provides an implementation for a primary
 * vertex finding tool, which uses the \<i\>Adaptive MultiVertex\</i\>
 * Fitter to solve the problem of finding the multiple
 * interaction vertices and to find out the best possible
 * assignment of the track to the vertices.
 *
 * The steps done are the following:
 * - the selection cuts are applied
 *
 * then iteratively:
 * - a new vertex is seeded with the remaining tracks
 *    (the seed finder is used)
 * - all the tracks whose Z at PCA is closer to the seeded
 *    vertex by more than TracksMaxZinterval (by JobOption),
 *    are added to the new vertex candidate
 * -  the new vertex candidate is added on top of the previous fit and
 *    the AdaptiveMultiVertexFitter is used to fit all them
 *    together (more information in the \<br\>\<i\>TrkVertexFitters\</br\>\</i\>
 *    package).
 * -  the tracks already used are removed from the tracks
 *    from which the next seed would be obtained and if there
 *    are more than 2 left, a new iteration is started.
 *
 * when no more than 2 seeding tracks are left:
 * - a vector of MVFVxCandidate is provided as result and
 *   according to the selection type, the order in which it is
 *   provided represents how high the probability of that
 *   particular vertex to come from the primary vertex is.
 *
 * In general the first VxCandidate* in the collection is
 * the one with highest sqrt(N_tracks)*Sum Pt_track^2. This
 * is the case if the selectiontype in the jobOptions is set
 * to 0 (default).
 *
 *
 * This finder is particularly suited for the high luminosities
 * scenarios which will came up at LHC.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Changes:
 *
 * David Shope <david.richard.shope@cern.ch> (2016-04-19)
 *
 * EDM Migration to xAOD - from Trk::VxCandidate to xAOD::Vertex,
 *                         from Trk::RecVertex   to xAOD::Vertex,
 *                         from Trk::Vertex      to Amg::Vector3D
 *
 * Also, VxMultiVertex EDM has been migrated to the following:
 *
 *   Trk::MvfFitInfo
 *     constraintVertex     now uses xAOD::Vertex
 *     seedVertex           now uses Amg::Vector3D
 *     linearizationVertex  now uses Amg::Vector3D
 *
 *   Trk::TrackToVtxLink
 *     Vertex objects stored using this class are now xAOD::Vertex
 *
 * Instead of using the MVFVxCandidate class, xAOD::Vertex is employed by
 * decorating it with the multi-vertex information:
 *
 *   bool                              isInitialized
 *   MvfFitInfo*                       MvfFitInfo
 *   std::Vector\<VxTrackAtVertex*\>     VTAV
 *
 *   This last decoration is needed in order to be able to use
 * MVFVxTrackAtVertex objects which have the additional information of
 * xAOD::Vertices associated to the track and (through polymorphism) to still be
 * able to pass them to the KalmanVertexUpdator as VxTracksAtVertex objects.
