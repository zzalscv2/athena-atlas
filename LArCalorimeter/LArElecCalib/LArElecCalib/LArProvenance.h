The Provenance (16 bits unsigned) defining how the LArRawChannel was reconstructed. The bit meaning is
0x00FF are used the store the offline algorithm used, in the same way as now. For instance provenance & 0x00FF == 0x00A5 would tell that the pulse was reconstructed with the OFC with all calibrations from the database.
0x0100 is used to store the information on the convergence of the OFC iteration.
0x0400 saturated pulse (ADC>=4095 or =< 0 )
0x0800 cell is masked as noisy cell (E/t/Q set to 0)
0x1000 is used to tell that the raw channel comes from the DSP and not offline computation.
0x2000 is used to tell that time and quality information are available for this channel
