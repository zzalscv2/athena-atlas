/**
 * @brief Property holding a SG store/key/clid/attr name from which a
 *        WriteDecorHandle is made.
 *
 * This class holds the key part of a WriteDecorHandle.
 *
 * Use this to add a decoration to an object such that the scheduler
 * is aware of it.  This is used just like a @c WriteHandleKey (which see)
 * except that the key string is of the form CCC.DDD, where CCC is the
 * name of the container in StoreGate and DDD is the name of the decoration.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *@code
 *  class MyAlgorithm : public AthReentrantAlgorithm {
 *    ...
 *    SG::WriteDecorHandleKey<MyCont> m_key{this, "Key",  "container.decor"};
 *  };
 *
 *  StatusCode MyAlgorithm::initialize()
 *  {
 *    ATH_CHECK( m_key.initialize() );
 *    ...
 *  }
 *
 *  StatusCode MyAlgorithm::execute (const EventContext& ctx) const
 *  {
 *    SG::WriteDecorHandle<MyCont, float> h (m_key, ctx);
 *    for (const MyObj& o : *h) {  // Access the container.
 *      h (o) = calculate (o);  // Add the decoration.
 *      ...
 *@endcode
 *
 * Alternatively, one can construct the key with an additional VarHandleKey
 * that represents the container and the key then only holds the decoration
 * name. This is useful to avoid hard-coding the container name twice in case
 * the algorithm also has a @c ReadHandleKey or @c WriteHandleKey for the container:
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *@code
 *  class MyAlgorithm : public AthReentrantAlgorithm {
 *    ...
 *    SG::WriteHandleKey<MyCont> m_whkey{this, "WHKey", "container"};
 *    SG::WriteDecorHandleKey<MyCont> m_wdhkey{this, "Key", m_whkey, "decor"};
 *  };
 *  ...
 *@endcode
 *
 * Implementation note: We want to make two dependencies from this key: a read
 * dependency on the container itself, and a write dependency on the decoration.
 * This class derives from @c WriteHandleKey, which provides the output dependency
 * on the decoration.  We also hold as a member a @c ReadHandleKey for the
 * container.  This extra dependency is added at initialize time via
 * registerWriteDecorHandleKey(), which see.
