/**
 * @brief Cached value with atomic update.
 *
 * Hold a cache of some value.
 * The cache may be set atomically through a const method.
 * This can happen in multiple threads, but the value set should be the same
 * in all threads.  The value can be either valid or invalid; it can be set
 * using the set() method.  (The value can also be set using the non-const
 * store() method; however, this is not atomic and should not be done while
 * other threads may be accessing the value.)  The validity of the value
 * may be tested with isValid(), and ptr() will get back a pointer to the value.
 * ptr() should not be called until isValid() has returned true or set()
 * returned.
 *
 * The state of the cached value is given by m_cacheState, which can have the values:
 *   INVALID:  No value has been cached.
 *   VALID:    The cached value is valid.
 *   UPDATING: Some thread is in the process of setting the value.
