/**
 * @brief Map from range to payload object, allowing concurrent, lockless reads.
 *
 * This class implements a map of sorted `range' objects (though only
 * a single value is actually used) to allocated payload objects.
 * Values can be looked up by a key; the value returned will be the
 * first for which the range is not less than the key.  We also
 * support insertions, erasures, and iteration.
 *
 * The only thing we need to do with the contained pointers is to delete them.
 * Rather than doing that directly, we take a deletion object as an argument
 * to the constructor.  This allows one to instantiate this template with @c void as @c T,
 * to reduce the amount of generated code.  The @c emplace method takes
 * a @c unique_ptr as an argument.  We define @c payload_unique_ptr which
 * is a @c unique_ptr to @c T that does deletion by calling an arbitrary function.
 * @c payload_unique_ptr may be initialized from a @c unique_ptr; to construct
 * one directly, the deletion function should be passed as a second argument
 * to the @c payload_unique_ptr constructor.
 *
 * There can be only one writer at a time; this is enforced with internal locks.
 * However, there can be any number of concurrent readers at any time.
 * The reads are lockless (but not necessarily waitless, though this should
 * not be significant in practice).  So this is appropriate when
 * reads are much more frequent than writes.
 *
 * This implementation also assumes that a lookup is most likely to be
 * for the last element in the map, that insertions are most likely to be
 * at the end, and that erasures are most likely to be from the beginning.
 * This class will still work if these assumptions are violated, but it
 * may be much slower.  (The use case for which this was targeted
 * was that of conditions containers.)
 *
 * Template arguments:
 *  RANGE - The type of the range object stored with each element.
 *  KEY - The type used to look up objects in the container.  This may be
 *        same as RANGE, but not necessarily.  (For example, RANGE may
 *        contain start and end times, while KEY may be a single time.)
 *  COMPARE - Object used for key comparisons; see below.
 *  UPDATER - Object used for memory management; see below.
 *
 * COMPARE should implement a less-than relation, like a typical STL
 * comparison object, with these signatures:
 *
 *@code
 *  bool operator() (const KEY& k1,   const RANGE& r2) const;
 *  bool operator() (const RANGE& r1, const RANGE& r2) const;
 *  bool inRange (const KEY& k, const RANGE& r) const;
 *
 *  // Test if two ranges overlap, and adjust if needed.
 *  // OLDRANGE is an existing range in the container, and NEWRANGE
 *  // is a new one being added.  Return one of:
 *  //   0 -- no overlap between the ranges; NEWRANGE is unmodified.
 *  //   1 -- ranges overlap.  NEWRANGE has been adjusted to avoid the overlap.
 *  //        If the start of NEWRANGE is changed, it must
 *  //        only be moved forward (increased), never backwards.
 *  //  -1 -- duplicate: NEWRANGE is entirely inside OLDRANGE.
 *  //        Delete the new range.         
 *  int overlap (const Context_t& ctx,
 *               const RANGE& oldRange, RANGE& newRange) const;
 *
 *  // Possibly extend an existing range at the end.
 *  // RANGE is the existing range, and NEWRANGE is the range
 *  // being added.  Returns one of:
 *  // Required only for extendLastRange --- which see.
 *  //   0 -- no change was made to RANGE.
 *  //   1 -- RANGE was extended. 
 *  //  -1 -- newRange is a duplicate.
 *  int extendRange (Range& range, const Range& newRange) const;
 @endcode
 *
 * In order to implement updating concurrently with reading, we need to
 * defer deletion of objects until no thread can be referencing them any more.
 * The policy for this for the internal implementation objects
 * is set by the template UPDATER<T>.  For details, see IsUpdater.h.
 *
 * Deletion of payload objects is managed via the @c IRangeMapPayloadDeleter
 * object passed to the constructor.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *   The values we store are pairs of RANGE, const T*.
 *   The data are stored in a vector of such values.
 *   We maintain atomic pointers to the first and last valid elements
 *   in the map.  We can quickly add an element to the end or delete
 *   an element from the beginning by adjusting these pointers.
 *   Any other changes will require making a new copy of the data vector.
