/**
 * @brief Hash table allowing concurrent, lockless reads.
 *
 * This class implements a simple hash map from uintptr_t to uintptr_t.
 * This class isn't meant to be used directly; rather, a more user-friendly
 * interface can be built on top of this.  Although here we deal only
 * with uintptr_t values, the hash and comparison operations are templated.
 * This allows for handling more complex types, where the values
 * stored in the map are pointers to the actual objects.  We support
 * inserting new items and modifying existing ones, and, with caveats,
 * deletion.
 * One value of the key must be reserved to indicate null; no keys with
 * that value may be inserted.
 * For deletion, a second distinct (tombstone) value of the key must be reserved
 * to mark deleted entries.
 *
 * Further caveats for deletion:
 *  - Deleted entries continue to occupy space in the table until the next
 *    time the table is reallocated.
 *  - Care must be taken if the key or value types require memory
 *    allocation.  Additional functionality may be required here to
 *    really support this.
 *  - An item may be deleted while there is a valid iterator referencing it.
 *    In that case, the key returned by the iterator will change to the
 *    tombstone value.
 *
 * There can be only one writer at a time; this is enforced with internal locks.
 * However, there can be any number of concurrent readers at any time.
 * The reads are lockless.  So this is appropriate when reads
 * are much more frequent than writes.
 *
 * Template arguments:
 *  UPDATER_ - Object used for memory management; see below.
 *             This has the same requirements as for ConcurrentRangeMap;
 *             see there for further details.
 *  HASHER_  - Functional to compute a hash value from a key.
 *             Defaults to std::hash.
 *  MATCHER_ - Functional to compare two keys for equality.
 *             Defaults to std::equal_to.
 *  NULLVAL_ - Value of the key to be considered null.
 *             A key with this value may not be inserted.
 *  TOMBSTONE_ - Value of the key used to mark a deleted entry.
 *               If identical to NULLVAL_, then deletions are not allowed.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *  We use open addressing (see, eg, knuth AOCP 6.4), in which the payloads
 *  are kept in the hash table itself.  We try to be cache friendly
 *  by probing all entries within a cache line before trying anything
 *  in a different cache line.  If the table gets full, we make a new, larger,
 *  instance copying the data from the old one.  The old table instances
 *  are then given to the Updater object to handle.
 *
 *  The implementation here is inspired by the hash maps from ConcurrencyKit
 *  (http://concurrencykit.org), though the code is all new.
 *
 * nb. Can't use plain `MATCHER' as a template argument because it collides
 * with gtest.
