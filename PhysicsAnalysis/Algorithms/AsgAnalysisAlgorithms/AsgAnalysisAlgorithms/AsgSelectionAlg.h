  /// \brief an algorithm for calling \ref IAsgSelectionTool
  ///
  /// There are two ways to implement this: The way I chose is to call
  /// the IAsgSelectionTool on the members of an IParticleContainer.
  /// Among several issues this has some inefficiencies, because it
  /// relies on dynamic_cast inside the IAsgSelectionTool.  Also,
  /// currently \ref CopyHandle only supports specific xAOD types for
  /// IParticleContainer (though in practice this only matters if
  /// systematics are applied in this algorithm).
  ///
  /// The alternative would be to implement this as a template, with
  /// one template argument for the tool interface type and a second
  /// template argument for the container type to run on.  Besides
  /// improving some of the efficiences, it would also allow using
  /// selector tools that don't implement the \ref IAsgSelectionTool
  /// interface (though arguably they should support the
  /// IAsgSelectionTool interface).  The main downside of that
  /// approach would be the need to support a templated algorithm,
  /// which I'm not even sure we have dual-use support for at the
  /// moment (19 Mar 18).
