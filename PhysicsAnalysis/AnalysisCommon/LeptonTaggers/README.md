LeptonTaggers
===================================
_JetTagNonPromptLepton_ package has been moved to this new location and named by _LeptonTaggers_. This package can be used to decorate leptons with the outputs from prompt lepton tagger tools during the derivation product. Please see the [Twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/PhysicsLightSoftTagging) for more information about the tools.
