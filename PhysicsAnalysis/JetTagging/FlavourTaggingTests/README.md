# ATLAS Release Tester flavour tagging code

The purpose of this package:
- Produces histograms of vertex-, tracking-, and flavour-tagging quantities from AODs and DAODs.
- Test trackless b-tagging functionality from RDOs to AODs.

In this way changes in the flavour-tagging and b-jet trigger code can be tested on a nightly basis.
More informations on how to use the b-jet code and run trackless b-tagging can be found in the [trigger implementation](https://ftag-sw.docs.cern.ch/trigger/) and [AODs with hits](https://ftag-sw.docs.cern.ch/DAOD/hits/) sections in the [Flavour Tagging Software Page](https://ftag-sw.docs.cern.ch/).
