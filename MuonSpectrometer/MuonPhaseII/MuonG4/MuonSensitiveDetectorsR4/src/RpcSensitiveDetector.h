/** @class RPCSensitiveDetector
    @section RPCSensitiveDetector Class methods and properties

The method RPCSensitiveDetector::ProcessHits is executed by the G4 kernel each
time a particle crosses one of the RPC gas gaps.
Navigating with the touchableHistory method GetHistoryDepth()
through the hierarchy of volumes crossed by the particle,
the Sensitive Detector determines the correct set of Simulation Identifiers
to associate to each hit. The RPC SimIDs are 32-bit unsigned integers, built 
using the MuonSimEvent/RpcHitIdHelper class
which inherits from the MuonHitIdHelper base class. 

We describe here how each field of the identifier is determined.

1) stationName, stationEta, stationPhi: when a volume is found in the hierarchy
   whose name contains the substring "station", the stationName is extracted
   from the volume's name. stationEta and stationPhi values are calculated
   starting from the volume's copy number.
   
2) doubletR:  when a volume is found in the hierarchy whose name contains
   the substring "rpccomponent", its copy number is used to calulate the
   doubletR of the hit.
   
3) gasGap: the substring "layer" is searched through the names of the volumes
   in the hierarchy. When a the volume is found, its copy number is used,
   together with the sign of the copy number of the "rpccomponent" to decide
   what is the correct gasGap value.
   
4) doubletPhi: when the volume with the substring "gas volume" in its name is
   found, its copy number is enough to determine the doubletPhi of the hit
   if the hit is registered in a standard chamber. For special chambers (i.e.
   chambers with only one gas gap per layer readout by two strip panels per
   direction, or chambers in the ribs) some a special attribution is done
   using also the stationName.
   
5) doubletZ: "gazGap" is the required substring in the volume's name. doubletZ
   attribution is fairly complicated. For standard chambers it just uses the
   sign of the copy number of the "rpccomponent", but severa
   arrangements (based on the stationName and the technology name) are needed
   for special chambers.
   
6) the doubletPhi calculated as described above needs one further correction
   for some chambers to take into account chamber rotation before placement
   in the spectrometer. This is done just before creating the hit.

    @section Some notes:

1) presently, chamber efficiency is assumed to be 100% at the level of the
   Sensitive Detector, i.e. two hits (one in eta and one in phi) are created
   each time the sensitive detector is created.

2) the hits created as described above contain information about their local
   position *in the gas gap* and the simulation identifier of *the strip panel*

3) the strip number is not assigned by the sensitive detector, and must be
   calculated by the digitization algorithm.

4) points 2 and 3 are due to the necessity of not introducing any dependency
   on the geometry description in the Sensitive Detector.

5) the present version of the Sensitive Detector produces hits which are
   different depending on whether hand coded G4 geometry or GeoModel is used
   for the geometrical description of the setup. When hand coded geometry
   is used, both GeoModel and the old MuonDetDescr can be used for digitization
   (using a proper tag of RPC_Digitization), while if GeoModel is used in the
   simulation, *it must be used* also in the digitization.

6) for each hit, the time of flight (the G4 globalTime), is recorded and
   associated to the hit.

7) the RPCHit object contains: the SimID, the globalTime, the hit local position
   and the track barcode.
