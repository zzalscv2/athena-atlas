  /**
   * This athena service will create an ONC/RPC (aka SunRPC) server, that can
   * provide the athena status as well as data strings from events. It can
   * handle several different event streams, but for each stream only the latest
   * event is available. This service is usually used by the Athena JiveXML
   * algorithm providing XML events for an Atlantis Java client.
   *
   * The server will create a single server thread, which loops over the sockets
   * until the m_runServerThread flag is set to false. On each request, it will
   * call the ONCRPCRequestHandler, which will generate a new thread for each
   * request. The actual response to the requests happens in these ONCRPCDispatchThread.
   * A list of the thread handles is kept in the a ThreadCollection, where each
   * thread will add and remove itself. In the finalization stage, the server
   * will wait for all dispatch threats to finish before exiting.
   * 
   * On all stages, the server thread will have a handle to the athena service
   * via the thread specific key ServerSvcKey. It is thus possible to have many
   * servers running simultaneously. Note however, that currently RPC will
   * forbid you to start several servers with the same ONCRPCSERVERPROG.
