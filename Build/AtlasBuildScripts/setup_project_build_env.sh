# Script that is used by the build_env.sh scripts of the individual projects.
# It takes care of setting up a functional build environment for an ATLAS
# project.
#
# The includer script must set (default) values for the following variables
# before sourcing this script:
#  - ATLAS_PROJECT_NAME: The name of the main project, for which this script
#    is building an "externals project".
#  - ATLAS_PROJECT_DIR: Directory of the project that this script is being used
#    from.
#  - ATLAS_EXT_PROJECT_NAME: The name of the "externals project" needed by the
#    ATLAS project being built. If not specified, an "externals project" is not
#    looked for. Instead environment variables are set up to find the AtlasCMake
#    and AtlasLCG modules in the atlasexternals checkout.
