# Code to handle creating the list of correction tools.
#
# The common code is in the class CaloClusterCorrSetup.
# You are expected to derive from it for your cluster type, and then
# create an instance.
# The following class variables must be defined in the derived class:
#  name:                  A short descriptive name of the type of cluster
#                         (to be written to the log file)
#
#  version_override_flag_name:
#                         Name of flag.
#                         If set, it overrides the selected correction
#                         version.
#
#  correction_generation_flag_name:
#                         Name of flag.
#                         If set, this gives the correction generation
#                         string that's embedded in tags written to the
#                         database.  This string should be changed for
#                         each write to the database.
#
#  correction_generation_default:
#                         Default value for the generation string,
#                         if the job property isn't set.
#
#  versions:              The table of all known correction versions.
#                         Should be a dictionary; the keys are correction
#                         version names, and the values are correction lists.
#                         A correction list is a list
#                         of individual corrections:
#
#                           [[CORR], [CORR], ...]
#
#                         where each individual correction here is also
#                         a list:
#
#                           [CORRFUNC, [VERSION,] [ORDER,] ARGS...]
#
#                         CORRFUNC is a function to call to create
#                         the correction; it should have the signature:
#
#                           def CORRFUNC (cells_name, suffix, version,
#                                         key, source, **kw):
#
#                         VERSION is a string giving the correction version.
#                         It may be omitted, and defaults to an empty string.
#                         It may also be `@', in which case the global
#                         version string is used instead.
#
#                         ORDER is an integer, giving the order in which
#                         the tools are intended to run.
#                         Not currently used (they were used by the metatool),
#                         but retained in case we want to use this
#                         for checking.
#
#                         The remainder of the list should be a set
#                         of (NAME,VALUE) tuples giving correction parameters
#                         to override.  This may be (and usually should be)
#                         empty.
#
#                         A key of `@' is used if the global correction
#                         version is tag-based (starts with `@').
#
# geom_versions:          The mapping between geometry versions and
#                         corrections versions.  A list of lists,
#                         each of which has the form
#
#                            [ GEOM-PATTERN, CORRECTION-VERSION ]
#
#                         Here, GEOM-PATTERN is a string that's matched
#                         against the geometry version string.  It may
#                         contain glob-style wildcards (as implemented
#                         by fnmatch).  CORRECTION-VERSION is a string
#                         giving the correction version to use.
#                         The patterns are tried in order; first
#                         to match wins.
#
# newest_version:         The name of the newest version.  This will be
#                         used if there's no match for the geometry
#                         string.

#
# Create a correction tool.
# FLAGS is the corrections flag object.
# VERSIONS is a table listing all the available versions of the corrections.
# It is a list of 4-element lists.  The last row should correspond to the
# most recent version of the correction.
# The first column is the version name.
# The second column is the Configurable class for the class which implements
# the correction.  This may also be a dictionary, to be indexed by
# a calorimeter sampling.
# The third column is a list containing the possible sources for this tool.
# This list may contain any of the following:
#
#   - A string giving the name of the parameter class used to initialize
#     the correction tool via job options.  It should be of the form
#     `MODULE.CLASS'.  If MODULE has no dots, we look for it in
#     CaloClusterCorrection.
#
#   - A string defined in poolfiles, giving the name of a pool file
#     that contains this correction.
#
#   - The string CALOCORR_COOL, indicating that this correction is available
#     in COOL.
#
#   - The string CALOCORR_NOPOOL, indicating that this tool is not
#     to be written to pool/cool (always gets initialized via job options).
#
# In the case of reading from job options, we look up the specified name.
# If this is a dictionary, we look up the requested sampling in the dictionary.
# We should then have a class; the names in this class are the parameter
# settings to make.  If any of them are dictionaries, then we look up the key
# in the dictionary.
#
# In the case of reading from cool, we construct folder and tag names
# with the following formats:
#
#    /CALO/<class>/<basename>
#    <class>.<basename>-<version>
#
# and a prefix in the format:
#
#    <key><sampling>.
#
# If we've already read a different version of this correction from
# the folder, then the read from cool fails (but we can fall back
# on a direct pool read or initialization from job options).
# Otherwise, we arrange to read this object; the StoreGate key
# will be the same as the folder name.
#
# In the case of reading from pool, the StoreGate key will be the same
# as the tag name we formed above.
#
# The fourth column is a list of cluster type keys that are valid for
# this correction.  When reading from pool, if the key we're given doesn't
# match one on this list, we replace it with the longest match (first
# one wins on ties) from this list.  Set this to None or omit it
# to skip this.
#
# NAME is the base name for this tool, excluding the suffix.  If set to None,
# a name will be constructed from the name of the correction, the version,
# the key, and the sampling (if applicable).
#
# BASENAME is the base name for the correction: a string like `gap',
# `etaoff', etc.
#
# If SUFFIX is not None, it will be added onto the end of the tool name.
#
# VERSION is a string specifying which of several versions of the correction
# to choose.  If set to None, the latest version of the correction is chosen.
# VERSION may also be of the form `@TAG' to force a specific COOL tag TAG,
# or it may be `@GLOBAL' to use to globally-configured COOL tag.
# In such cases, if there's no direct match of the version string
# in the version table, we look for one with a version of `@'.
# If no match for that is found, the last entry in the table
# will be used.
#
# KEY is a string to specify the type of cluster to which the correction
# applies.  The convention is to use `ele55' for 5x5 electron clusters,
# `gam35' for 3x5 photon clusters, and so on.
# If KEY is the special string `@VALID_KEYS', then we do not create
# a tool.  Instead, we return the list of keys that are declared
# to be valid for this tool (or None, if none were).
#
# Some corrections have different tools for different calorimeter samplings.
# If this is the case for this correction, SAMPLING should be set to the
# applicable sampling.  Otherwise, set it to None.
#
# SOURCE tells from where we should read the calibration constants.
#  CALOCORR_JO means to read the constants from job options.
#    Look in the correction's source list to find the parameter class.
#  CALOCORR_POOL means to read the constants from a pool file.
#    Look in the correction's source list to find the pool file.
#  CALOCORR_COOL means to read from cool.
#  A string of the form `MODULE.NAME' means to use this name
#    as the parameter class.
#  A string that's present in the poolfiles dictionary means to read
#    from this pool file.
#
#  SOURCE may also be a list of these, to try in order.
#
#  SOURCE may also be CALOCORR_TOPOOL, meaning to construct a tool
#  from job options appropriate for writing to a pool file.
#
# CONFCLASS gives the Configurable class to use to create the tool.
# If set to None, this is taken from the version table.
#
# CORRCLASS is the correction class string, as defined above.
#
# GENERATION is the generation string to embed in COOL tags.
#
# ORDER specifies the relative order in which this tool should be executed.
#
# Additional keyword arguments may be passed to override any tool
# parameters/constants.
